A kind of good screenshare tool.

## What does it scan for?
Mods, only mods. I don't really have a passion to work on it anymore due to recent events.

## How do I use it?
Let the player run the exe file and send the LIGHT diagnostic file. Is there's anything suspicious (for example, a mod that doesn't match a hash), then tell them to send you the HEAVY diagnostic file which contains all base64 encodes of the mods that they have. üëç 

## Technical
### What's your compiler?
I used pkg on npm. **download it as a global variable.**
### Why did you declare `const colours`, but you never used it?
Check the counters. üëç
### Why didn't you use FETCH with Nodejs or axios?
I didn't want to update my Nodejs and pkg version.
